# How it started
When I started blogging, I was still in engineering school. And the world of websites and blogs was still new to me. So when I wanted to create a personal blog, I turned to what I thought was the best solution at the time: WordPress.

Like it or not, WordPress is quite easy to use for beginners, even more for me who was still discovering how to host a website at the time.

So, with a brand new OVH account, I was able to quickly setup my personal blog in a few clicks!

And when the time came where I wanted to create a blog dedicated to professional topics, I naturally came back to my ol' friend WordPress.

# Issues arised

But after some months, the glory of WordPress started to fade into a darker view. Sure, it was convenient to add a new post by going through WordPress' UI, but maintaining the website was always boresome. Moreover, a WordPress installation requires using a database, which incured a higher bill at the end of each month.

All of this for a blog that I knew did not receive many visits each day.

Surely there was a better way to do this.
