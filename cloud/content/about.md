My name is Antoine Delia, and I love automating stuff!

I started working as a Full-Stack engineer, and was able to learn many things related to websites.

I then became a Cloud Engineer, where I discovered the wonderful world of the Cloud, mainly AWS.

Today, I am an Automation Technology Specialist, and I help bringing Connectivity topics to life thanks to automation.

On this blog, I want to talk about many thing related to the Cloud and the DevOps culture. I hope you will enjoy!
